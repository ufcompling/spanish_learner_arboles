Hola , yo me llamo Natalie .
Tengo 35 anos .
Mi familia es de San Francisco en Ramada Inn .
Pero yo nací en los Estados Unidos .
Crecí en una casa bilingüe , pero desafortunadamente creciendo , el español se usó menos .
Siempre había crecido deseando aprender a escribir en español .
Intenté duolingo , pero no me gusto .
I took up french in High school , because I grew up in New York where it is used a lot ! It is nice knowing 3 languages , but I soon realized I had to become fluent in Spanish .
I speak to my family from time to time from Mexico on Facebook .
I can read it better than write it !
I was embaressed to answer at times , because I knew I was not spelling things correctly .
So when I came to Harvard I took up the opportunity to take a spanish class in the Spring .
I loved it !
The professor was very patient and nice .
I felt more confident in communicating with my family .
So this fall I decided to take it up once again .
